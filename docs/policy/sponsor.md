# Sponsor Policy

The Public Safety Outfitters is always looking to sponsor new and exciting groups. Below is some of the policy, information, and things we look for in a group.

• Group more then 100+ Members (That are not bots)

• Active game with 30+ playing.

• Active Discord with 50+ Members and active talking throughout the server.

• Professional staff and management.

If we feel at any point one of these may have failed or no longer fit we will terminate the sponsorship with the group.

If you are interested in being sponsored by us for new uniforms, logos, ads or vehicle liveries please contact maddie at ***maddie@public-safety-outfitters.com*** or ***@LXMON#0001***
