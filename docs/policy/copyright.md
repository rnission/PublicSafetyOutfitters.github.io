# Copyright Policy

We here at PSO (Public Safety Outfitters) never want to DMCA Takedown on anybody or send a DMCA Notification to somebody but sometimes those things do happen.

We mainly follow the US Copyright Law which you can find more information about that **[here](https://www.copyright.gov/)**.

Aswell as we are apart of the Roblox Community we also follow their copyright policy. For reference our copyright policy will be exactly similar to Roblox Corporate, Inc. Which can be found **[here](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Copyright-Guidance)**.

If you find somebody who may have taken, stolen or published/claimed that they have made something that is from Public Safety Outfitters or that you commissioned and someone took it from you please contact our legal team at ***legal@public-safety-outfitters.com*** with the following information listed below,

```
