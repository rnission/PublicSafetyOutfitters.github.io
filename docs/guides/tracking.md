# Commission Tracking
Confused on how to track the progress on your order? Need help figuring where your order is at and when it'll be done?

Well you've came to the right place. Here at Public Safety Outfitters we try our hardest to get your orders arrived to you on time and before your deadline. There has been very very rare/few times we were unable to deliver on deadline.

So you may be wondering how do you track your progress?

Currently we are working on a discord bot that allows you to track your status and everything within discord without having to go to a seperate website such as **[trello](https://trello.com/b/AVIQjeed/maddies-commissions)**.

At the moment you can track your commission and all the information that our designers have through trello by clicking **[here](https://trello.com/b/AVIQjeed/maddies-commissions)**.
