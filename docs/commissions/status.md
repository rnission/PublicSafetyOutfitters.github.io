# Order Types
This will explain briefly what the different order statuses mean.

**Pending Status** 

This means that you probably just ordered and your commission request is pending review by Maddie!


**At Art Design**

This means that if you ordered something that we don't already have in our warehouse we will be designing ourselves and could take a couple of days before being sent to the warehouse.


**At Warehouse** 

This means you just placed an order or are waiting for the production date to be closer before pulling the items from the warehouse and boxing them up to be sent to Screenprint/Embroidery.


**At Screenprint/Embroidery**

This means that the progress of designing your custom uniforms is in the progress of being designed to your exact liking!


**Preparing to ship**

This means that we are awaiting payment and once payment is received it's moved onto the mail to be shipped!


**Shipping**

This means that the item is shipped and waiting for your approval!


**Delivered**

Simple as that your custom clothing has been designed and you approved it! Enjoy the new style and look!


**Refund Request Sent**

This just means you were sent an email or message on discord requesting you to make a t-shirt for a certain amount of R$ as considered as a refund.
