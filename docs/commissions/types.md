# Order Types
Here you can find information on what certain order types mean.

**ðŸ”¥ Hot Market**

Hot Market burns hot, but it doesnâ€™t burn long, and if you canâ€™t move fast enough youâ€™ll miss it. Thatâ€™s why we hustle like nobodyâ€™s business. Our production team will complete your design and deliver it to you the same day.

**Hot Job** 

Oh no, you started a business and need uniforms done immediately? This is the right delivery for you! The hot job gets the job done in a hot timely efficient manner. Rock your uniforms in just days of ordering!

**Quick Job**

Quick Job is for those who are in a rush at the same time your not. Want your uniforms and clothing finished fast in a timely yet efficient manner? This is the delivery for you!

**Regular**

Want your order done but your deadline is in a couple of weeks? This is the right delivery option for you. We will work on your order behind the scenes and get it finished in just a couple of weeks. Rock those new uniforms in style!

**Sample**

This means a high-value customer wanted to see what something would look like f.e. they want to see what a White shirt with brown pants look together they can get a sample this is commonly used for people who only want more then 60+ shirts.

**Pending Status**

This just means your order is being processed or awaiting payment.

**Shipped Short**

Shipping Short is something we never want to do. Although if the customer needs the clothing fast at the same time we are unable to fully complete it by the deadline then we will send what we have designed and finish the rest as soon as possible.

**Backordered**

This means we are full of commissions and that the person's order has been back-ordered also known as being put on a waiting list. This very rarely happens this typically would only happen if theres a high demand in uniforms that week.

**Cancelled by Customer**

This means you cancelled your order after it was processed. 


**Cancelled by Seller**
Cancelling an order is something we never want to ever do. Sometimes there are occasions we need to cancel and order for many things some of the most common issues are the following
